# Credit-Card-Churn-Analysis
An analysis of credit card churn to determine key factors in customer churn


"Despite estimated_salary being a common demographic metric, initial correlation analysis yielded a coefficient of 0.012, indicating virtually no linear relationship with churn. This insight, combined with the discovery of a uniform distribution, led to the decision to prioritize behavioral features (e.g., active_member, products_number) which demonstrated significantly higher predictive power."
