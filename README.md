Strategic Analysis: The "Saturation Ceiling"
The most significant finding of this study is the identification of a 100% Attrition Rate among customers holding four or more products. While traditional banking KPIs often prioritize "product per household" as a measure of stickiness, this data suggests a dangerous Saturation Ceiling.

Key Insights:
The Loyalty Sweet Spot (2 Products): Customers with exactly two products represent the bank's most stable segment, with a churn rate of only 7.5%. This suggests a balanced relationship where the customer is integrated but not over-leveraged.

The Critical Failure Point (3+ Products): As product count increases beyond two, churn risk scales exponentially rather than linearly. The jump from 7.5% to 100% churn for 4-product holders indicates that high product density is a leading indicator of relationship dissolution.

Behavioral Implications: In a retail banking context, a customer holding 4 products who then exits may be reflecting "consolidation for closure"—gathering all assets into one place specifically to facilitate a total transfer to a competitor.

Business Recommendations:
Stop Aggressive Cross-Selling: For customers already holding two products, the focus should shift from "Quantity" to "Quality of Service."

Automated Risk Triggers: Any customer moving from 2 to 3 products should be flagged for a proactive "Success Call" from a Relationship Manager to ensure the onboarding of the new product is seamless.

Audit the "4th Product": Investigate if a specific 4th product (e.g., a specific high-fee loan or complex insurance rider) is the primary driver of friction.

"Analysis reveals that while 2 products represent the 'Loyalty Sweet Spot' (7.6% churn), account consolidation into 3 or 4 products serves as a 90%+ reliable leading indicator of imminent attrition."
